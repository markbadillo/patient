Nutrition is very poor with pre-albumin at 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPI: This is a very complex 75yoWF who had been admitted **** due to **** and \n\nfound down at home for 18 hours after HH nurse found her (she had no phone \n\naccess and her life alert had been turned off) following a 3 week hospital \n\ncourse at **** (****\/2022) due to **** hospital stay on **** \n\ndue to confusion from sepsis from pelvic abscess required drainage by IR due to \n\nileostomy reversal leak and subsequent abscess formation. She has a h\/o subtotal\n\ncolectomy with ileostomy on **** due to pseudomembranous colitis causing \n\nischemic bowel and that was performed by Dr ****. The recent ileostomy reversal \n\nwas performed by Dr ****. She was admitted for observation and IVF \n\non med-surg and promptly moved to IRF due to weakness and need to strengthen \n\nprior to DC but shortly after she arrived in **** she was found to have a fever \n\nof 38.6 and tachycardia of 142 and sepsis w\/u initiated and found to have COVID \n\ninfection with lactic acidosis not due to sepsis so the decision was made to \n\nmove to ICU. Pt was placed on levofloxacin for sepsis and pelvic abscess. Pt has\n\nhx of CHF, so spironolactone and lasix were also started. Lovenox started for \n\nDVT prophylaxis. General surgery was consulted for central line placement and \n\npossible drain removal. Dr. **** placed central line, but drain was not removed \n\nat this time. Pt remained stable in **** and on **** she was transferred to 4th \n\nfloor and remained in isolation for COVID. Pt was not requiring oxygen at this \n\ntime. On **** pts colostomy bag began to leak and general surgery was consulted.\n\nDr. **** saw pt and plans to remove the drain at some point. Since pt is not \n\nrequiring oxygen and vitals are within normal limits, decision was made to move \n\npt to inpatient rehab facility. Chemistry panel showed corrected calcium of 7.5,\n\nso pt started on Tums three times daily and vitamin D level will be checked. Pt \n\nwill remain in isolation until **** according to hospitals infection control s\n\npecialist. Goals of care are rehabilitation and strength training to get pt \n\ncloser to baseline. Pt medically stable for d\/c to IRF today .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****,**** **** **** STUDENT\n\n\n\n\n\nPast Medical-Social-Family Hx\n\n\nPast Med\/Social Hx:  Reviewed Nursing Past Med\/Soc Hx, Reviewed and Corrections \n\nmade\n\n\nPatient ****\n\n\nMarrital Status:  single\n\n\nEmployed\/Student:  retired\n\n\nAlcohol Use:  Denies Use\n\n\nSmoking Status:  Former Smoker\n\n\nFormer Smoker, Quit:  ****5\n\n\nType Used:  Cigarettes\n\n\n2nd Hand **** Exposure:  No\n\n\nRecent Hopitalizations:  No\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunizations Up To Date\n\n\nDate of Pneumonia Vaccine:  ****\n\n\nDate of Influenza Vaccine:  ****\n\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal Allergies\n\n\nSeasonal Allergies:  No\n\n\n\n\n\nPast Medical History\n\n\nSurgeries:  Abdominal, Bowel Surgery, Cardiac, Gallbladder, Hysterectomy, \n\nNephrectomy, Oophorectomy, Tonsillectomy\n\n\nCurrently Using CPAP:  No\n\n\nCardiac:  Atrial Fibrillation, High Cholesterol, Hypertension\n\n\nReproductive:  Yes (OVARIAN CANCER)\n\n\nSexually Transmitted Disease:  No\n\n\nHIV\/AIDS:  No\n\n\nHysterectomy, Menopausal\n\n\nGenitourinary:  Bladder Infection\n\n\nsolitary kidney\n\n\nGastrointestinal:  Colitis, Gastroesophageal Reflux, Liver Disease\/Jaundice, C-\n\nDiff, **** Bladder Disease\n\n\nMusculoskeletal:  Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\n\nEndocrine:  Hypothyroidsim, Diabetes, Non-Insulin dep\n\n\nCancer:  Ovarian\n\n\nDid You Recieve Any Treatments:  Yes\n\n\nWhat Type of Treatment Did You:  Surgical Intervention\n\n\nHistory of Blood Disorders:  No\n\n\nAdverse Reaction to Blood ****:  No\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily History\n\n\n\n\n\nArthritis\n\n\n  19 MOTHER\n\n\nCardiovascular disease\n\n\n  19 MOTHER\n\n\nDiabetes mellitus\n\n\n  19 FATHER\n\n\n  19 MOTHER\n\n\nNo Pertinent Family Hx\n\n\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL \/SURGICAL HISTORY:\n\n\n-****--HAD SEVERE C.

She has had\n\na history of Clostridium difficile, toxic megacolon requiring a subtotal\n\ncolectomy.  This was later reversed.  She was very weak and was in long-term\n\nacute care hospital for some amount of time.  She again became weak and fell at\n\nhome.  She was found to be COVID positive.  She is tachycardic and has very poor\n\nperipheral venous circulation and will require a central venous catheter.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\n\nChest and neck were prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  A 1%\n\nlidocaine was used to anesthetize the left subclavian region.  The left\n\nsubclavian vein was then cannulated with drawing of venous blood and the\n\nguidewire was then inserted without any resistance.  Cannulating needle was\n\nremoved and a skin incision was made using 11 blade.  A tract was then created\n\nusing a venous dilator and through this opening, a triple lumen central venous\n\ncatheter was placed over the guidewire using the Seldinger technique.  The\n\nguidewire was removed and all three ports drew venous blood and saline pushed in\n\nwithout any resistance.  Catheter was then sutured to the skin using interrupted\n\n3-0 silk sutures, cleaned, and covered with Op-Site.\n\n\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  We will get a post procedure chest\n\nx-ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n**** ****: ****\n\nDocumentID: ****\n\nDictated Date:  **** 12:44:22\n\nTranscription Date: **** 16:23:52\n\nDictated By: ****, MD"

        "DATE OF SERVICE:  ****\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\n\nThe patient is a 75-year-old female with an extensive past medical history.  She\n\nhad a significant Clostridium difficile colic causing toxic megacolon requiring\n\na subtotal colectomy and an end ileostomy.  This was done at **** Hospital. \n\nShe then underwent a reversal of the colostomy.  She then did develop a pelvic\n\nabscess, which was drained by interventional radiology.  She also did develop a\n\nfistula as well.  She was admitted for weakness and found to be COVID positive. \n\nShe also has a very poor peripheral venous circulation and is febrile and\n\ntachycardic and will require a central venous catheter.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\nClostridium difficile toxic megacolon, gastroesophageal reflux disease,\n\ndegenerative joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypothyroid, history\n\nof ovarian cancer, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.\n\n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\n\nExploratory laparotomy, subtotal colectomy, colostomy reversal, laparoscopic\n\ncholecystectomy, total hysterectomy, nephrectomy, and tonsillectomy.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:\n\nPENICILLIN.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n\nAmitriptyline 100 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg daily,\n\ncetirizine 10 mg daily, famotidine 20 mg daily, fenofibrate 160 mg daily, iron\n\n325 mg b.i.d., latanoprost eyedrops daily, leflunomide 20 mg every other day,\n\nlevothyroxine 125 mcg daily, and oxybutynin 5 mg b.i.d.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\n\nNegative smoke and negative alcohol.\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n\nNoncontributory.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n\nThis a slightly thin-appearing female, currently in no acute distress.  She is\n\nnot experiencing any shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing.  No cough\n\nor sputum production.  She is experiencing no nausea, vomiting; however, does\n\nnot have much of an appetite.  She states that she does have bowel movements and\n\ndoes have a gastrointestinal fistula with minimal drainage.  She is having some\n\nfevers and has lost weight since her colon resection.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 38.9, blood pressure 1****, pulse 102, respirations\n\n25, and pulse ox 92% on room air.\n\nCHEST:  Few scattered rales bilaterally.\n\nHEART:  Regular and no murmurs.\n\nEXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity edema and negative **** sign.\n\nHEENT:  No scleral icterus.\n\nNECK:  No cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended.\n\nSKIN:  Warm and dry.\n\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA:\n\nWBC 6.4, hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 34, and platelets 219.  BUN 8 and\n\ncreatinine 0.83.  Lactic acid 2.16.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\nA 75-year-old female with COVID-19, weakness, debility, and respiratory failure.\n\n She has a very poor peripheral venous circulation and will require central\n\nvenous catheter, which we will proceed with.  She also does have a fistula at\n\nthe area of the previous ileorectal anastomosis with an indwelling catheter.  At\n\nthis time, there is minimal drainage and our recommendation is to remove the\n\ncatheter in hopes of allowing the fistula to close on its own without any\n\nsurgical intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n**** ****: ****\n\nDocumentID: ****\n\nDictated Date:  **** 12:42:00\n\nTranscription Date: **** 13:31:32\n\nDictated By: ****, MD"
